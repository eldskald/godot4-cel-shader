# Godot 4 Complete Cel Shader

This project is a demo of my Cel Shader for Godot 4. This is a continuation of [this project](https://godotshaders.com/shader/complete-toon-shader/), the old version of this shader for Godot 3. Feel free to mess around with it and study!

## Instructions

Just put [cel-shader-base.gdshader](/src/shaders/cel-shader-base.gdshader) and the [includes](/src/shaders/includes) folder on your project, on the same folder. Whenever you want a material with one of the additional features, make a copy of [cel-shader-base.gdshader](/src/shaders/cel-shader-base.gdshader) and change the defines that you want to 1 and put it on the material.
